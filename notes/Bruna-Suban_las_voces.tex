Calahorra edited this work from a source in Girona that I have not been able
to locate.
That source includes a different poetic text for the coplas, which after the
first strophe, is in a meter that does not fit the musical setting.

The present edition is based solely on a separate source, a previously
unattributed set of parts in the Biblioteca de Catalunya, which agrees with
the Girona source in the vocal parts but has different copla text.
This text, I argue, is the original text of teh coplas, and it is more
coherent poetically and theologically.
This version lacks the \term{entablatura} part that is in the other edition;
it is primarily a \term{basso seguente} that may have been added later.
