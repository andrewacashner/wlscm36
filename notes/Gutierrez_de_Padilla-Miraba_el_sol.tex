This Tenor part is preserved in a manuscript anthology of villancicos in the
Puebla Cathedral archive.
It is part of a larger collection that includes motets by Palestrina and
others, complete with a crude handwritten copy of the title page of a
Palestrina print.
The source Leg. 34 may have been a miscellaneous collection of exemplary
pieces made by a student, bound together by an archivist at a later date.
